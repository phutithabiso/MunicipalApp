# üèôÔ∏è Local Events and Announcements Application

## üìò Overview
The **Local Events and Announcements Application** is a C# program designed to help users discover, filter, and view community events efficiently.  
It integrates **data structures and algorithms** such as **stacks, queues, priority queues, dictionaries, sorted dictionaries, and sets**, and includes an **event recommendation system** that suggests relevant events based on user searches.

---

## üß† Objectives
This project demonstrates:
- Application of **data structures** for efficient data management.
- Use of **collections** (Queues, Stacks, Priority Queues, Dictionaries, Sets).
- **Recommendation system** based on user search history.
- A **functional, interactive UI** (Windows Forms or Console-based).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Requirements & Implementation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Stacks, Queues, Priority Queues (15 Marks)
**Purpose:** Manage event-related workflows efficiently.  
**Implementation:**
- **Queue** ‚Äì Handles *upcoming events* in chronological order.  
- **Stack** ‚Äì Tracks *recently viewed events*.  
- **PriorityQueue** ‚Äì Prioritizes *urgent events* (soonest first).

```csharp
Queue<Event> upcomingEvents = new Queue<Event>();
Stack<Event> recentlyViewed = new Stack<Event>();
PriorityQueue<Event, DateTime> urgentEvents = new PriorityQueue<Event, DateTime>();
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Hash Tables, Dictionaries, Sorted Dictionaries (15 Marks)
**Purpose:** Organize and retrieve event information quickly.  
**Implementation:**
- **Dictionary** ‚Äì Stores events by title for quick lookups.  
- **SortedDictionary** ‚Äì Organizes events by date for sorted listings.  
- **HashSet** ‚Äì Maintains unique event categories.

```csharp
Dictionary<string, Event> eventsByTitle = new Dictionary<string, Event>();
SortedDictionary<DateTime, List<Event>> eventsByDate = new SortedDictionary<DateTime, List<Event>>();
HashSet<string> categories = new HashSet<string>();
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Sets (10 Marks)
**Purpose:** Maintain **unique categories or event dates** to avoid duplication.

```csharp
HashSet<string> uniqueCategories = new HashSet<string>();
uniqueCategories.Add("Music");
uniqueCategories.Add("Sports");
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Recommendation Feature (30 Marks)
**Purpose:** Suggest related events based on user searches and preferences.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Track user search frequency in a `Dictionary<string, int>`.
2. Identify the most frequently searched category.
3. Recommend events within that category.

```csharp
Dictionary<string, int> userSearchCounts = new Dictionary<string, int>();

void TrackSearch(string category)
{
    if (userSearchCounts.ContainsKey(category))
        userSearchCounts[category]++;
    else
        userSearchCounts[category] = 1;
}

List<Event> RecommendEvents()
{
    string topCategory = userSearchCounts.OrderByDescending(x => x.Value).First().Key;
    return eventsByTitle.Values.Where(e => e.Category == topCategory).ToList();
}
```

**Output Example:**
```
Recommended Events:
- Music Festival (Music) on 2025/12/01
- Jazz Night (Music) on 2025/12/03
```

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run the Project

### **Requirements**
- Visual Studio 2022 or later  
- .NET 6 or newer  
- Windows OS  

### **Steps**
1. Clone or download the project folder.  
2. Open the solution file (`MunicipalApp.sln`) in Visual Studio.  
3. Build the project (`Ctrl + Shift + B`).  
4. Run the application (`F5` or ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button).  
5. Use the filters (category/date) and search events.  
6. The recommendation list updates dynamically based on user activity.
